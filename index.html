      <p class="subheadingText">
        I grew up in Bedfordshire where I attended school and sixth form. Initially I was on track to study a law at university, however after undertaking work experience in a firm
        I decided to switch field to Biomedical science. Throughout my degree I have learnt various lab testing techniques, my final dissertation was on the effectivenss of monoclonal antibodies in treating autoimmune disorders. 
        On the weekends and in my spare time I dance salsa and bachata, and currently am one belt away from a black belt in karate.
