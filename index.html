        <p class="subheadingText">
          I grew up in Bedfordshire where I attended school and sixth form. Initially I was on track to study a law at university, however after undertaking work experience in a law firm I decided to switch field to Biomedical Science. Throughout my degree I have learnt various lab testing techniques, my final dissertation was on the effectivenss of monoclonal antibodies in treating autoimmune disorders. On the weekends and in my spare time I dance salsa and bachata, and currently am one belt away from a black belt in karate.

          <h3>What’s the purpose of IT in modern business?</h3>
          <p>IT plays a crucial role in modern business, this is because it enables efficient communication with customers. Good customer relations generates a more reliable public image. Through business operating digitally, customers are able to access information whenever they require it, thus avoiding a backlog of calls to the business. IT systems support communication between employees who could be in different areas, enabling smoother business operations.  Platforms such as Skype for business and slack help to reduce formality between employees, this can contribute to a better workplace environment. A major benefit businesses with digital platforms is that the geographical location of consumers no longer becomes a limiting factor.

          <h3>What causes digital projects to fail</h3>
          <p>A prominent reason for failure results when a business sacrifices strategy for digital innovation, as this can impact the business processes negatively i.e. being slowed down or altered. The business’ goals need to be aligned with the digital design, as this allows for a smooth integration of new products into the business operations.

          <h3>How does GDPR impact digital projects ? </h3>
          <p>The purpose of GDPR is to update and regulate privacy and consent for digital users, this ensures the responsible handling of customers personal data by organisations. GDPR also emphasises the importance of customer consent and their knowledge of the ways in which businesses are utilising their data. Based on this, GDPR changes the way businesses collect, store and use customer data. Business employees running digital projects should be educated on the correct ways to handle customer data. Failure to correctly handle data could result in major fines, additionally there could be a loss of trust from the customer. This can be detrimental to the business. 
          </p>

          <h3>How would you go about testing digital solutions</h3>
          <p>The digital customer experience is more important nowadays than a physical one, as a result companies are investing more into ensuring the seamless running of their digital platforms. There are 3 different levels at which business test their software, these ensure complete quality control of the platform.
          The first stage of digital testing  is known as the development phase. The platform is tested through isolating different units and seeing how well they perform their functions. It is crucial that this phase is passed.
          Integrity testing is the second phase, this tests how well the software performs in different environments ensuring that the platform meets the business requirements. The software passes this stage once it meets its specific technical and functional skills. The third stage involves the complete integration of the software and its functionality being tested by the user, this stage is imperative as the user experience has to be of a high quality to ensure overall customer satisfaction. The testing of digital solutions ensure businesses undergo digital transformation by reducing the risk of implementing digital innovations.

          <h3>How do copyright and other constraints affect websites?</h3>
          <p>Copyright gives creators legal ownership of their work, this includes many types of expression such as artistic, musical as well as creative. Copyright constraints affect the terms of ownership for websites and its content, with website creators placing copyright notices to prevent people potentially duplicating their work for financial gain. </p>

          <h3>How can we overcome issues people with disabilities may face when using webpages?<h3>
          <p>Web accessibility is an important tool that helps people with disabilities easily navigate the internet, it’s essential as it provides equal access and opportunity to people regardless of their disability. There is currently a need for more websites to developed in a way which enables people of all abilities to perceive, understand and contribute to the web. One way to implement seamless integration of accessibility features is ensure these features are incorporated during the creation of the website. This reduces the need to go through and redo old code, which can be both time consuming and result in more debugging. One application which enables deaf people to communicate through text is known as real-time text, this works similar to a voice conversion and allows real time communication. Total conversion is used by deaf and deaf blind people, this incorporates voice, text and video to facilitate phone conversations.
