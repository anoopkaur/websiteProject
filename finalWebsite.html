      <h3>A bit about me...</h3>
      <p>
          I grew up in Bedfordshire where I attended school and sixth form.
          Subsequently after school I studied biomedical science in the University
          of Kent. Some of my favourite hobbies are Salsa dancing, gymming and
          eating

      computers! Learning how to code is imperative to adapt and learn the
      tools to be able to contribute to society, this is one of the main
      reasons I got into coding and technology. Another reason is the coder's
      high solving a hard problem brings!!! + code nation stuffs here.
